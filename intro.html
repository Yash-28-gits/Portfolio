        <h1>Hi,</h1>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Yash Rohilla, a 20-year-old currently immersed in my B.Tech journey in Computer Science at SRM University. My fascination with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and cybersecurity knows no bounds. Delving deeper into the digital abyss, I'm captivated by the enigmatic world of the dark web and the expansive dimensions of the internet that stretch far beyond what meets the eye in our everyday lives. It's both chilling and mesmerizing to explore the intricate layers of the online realm. When I'm not unraveling digital mysteries, you'll find me lost in the gripping narratives of crime thrillers in movies and series. However, what truly sets my imagination on fire is the ambitious quest to engineer a humanoid robot, blurring the boundaries between technology and human essence. Join me as I navigate through the complexities of technology, driven by curiosity and the relentless pursuit of innovation.</p>
